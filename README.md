# ESP32 - Arduino Cloud IOT


This is starter of IoT project focusing on ESP32 module which bundled with Wifi, Bluetooth and Temperature. I develop it on [Arduino Web Editor](https://app.arduino.cc/) so, it have standard library for use Arduino Cloud.

## Hardware
- ESP32 DEV KIT V1 module
- Raindrops module
- DHT22

## Software
- Arduino Cloud Account (Free plan available)
- [CP210x Driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) for your PC/MAC to recognize your ESP32 module. 
- [Arduino Cloud Agent](https://cloud.arduino.cc/download-agent/) required if you need to connect to the module.
- Google Home (optional) 


Very easy to make it online with [Arduino Cloud](https://app.arduino.cc/). Especially if you develop on it's sketch. After you created cloud variables, then it'll ready to use as source code in (thingProperties.h)[thingProperties.h].
