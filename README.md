# ESP32 - Arduino Cloud IOT


This is starter of IoT project focusing on ESP32 module which bundled with Wifi, Bluetooth and Temperature. 

First of all, please prepare IoT modules at your side.
- ESP32 DEV KIT V1 module
- Raindrops module
- DHT22

Try it !!
```
17:33:22.330 -> ESP32 on-board output   >> Temp: 45.56°C
17:33:22.372 -> DHT22 output            >> Temp: 30.80°C, Humidity: 51.90%
17:33:22.413 -> Raindrops output        >> 0
```
If you got any errors, you can try to comment all lines with `ArduinoCloud`.

## Make it Online
[Arduino Cloud](https://app.arduino.cc/) is now required. The simplest way, please configure your own one and download [arduino_secrets.h](arduino_secrets.h), [sketch.json](sketch.json) and [thingProperties.h](thingProperties.h) into your project. Then try it again, your data is now existing on Arduino Cloud !!
